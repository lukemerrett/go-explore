    Title: Outside The Maze
    Body: |
          You stand at the edge of a large fortified maze
          12 foot high stone walls face you to the east and west, stretching far as the eye can see
          In front of you to the north is a small entrance, concealed under years of heavy foliage
          To the left is a sign that reads "A grand prize awaits you in the center, enter if you dare"

    Title: Going Home
    Body: |
          You gave up, and left the maze uncomplete
          Whilst you wonder what may have awaited you behind those walls
          You can't help but feel you made the right choice...
    End Scene: True
  Bottom Left:
    Title: Dead End
    Body: |
          The path ends abruptly at a stone wall.
          On it, faint scratch marks can be seen on the ancient rock
          At your feet, you notice similar marks in the soil, as if someone, or something, was dragged away...

    Title: Overgrown
    Body: |
          The foliage here becomes almost oppressive, blocking what little light comes over the walls
          Pulling apart the branches, you see the path continues on to the north
          Though you will have to crawl under the vegetation to get through

    Title: Doorway
    Body: |
          Ahead, you see the rememants of an old doorway, its frame set into the stone
          The wooden door itself lies torn to shreds further along the pathway
          Splinters litter the floor at your feet.

    Title: The Burrows
    Body: |
          As your trace the stone wall round, you notice a set of small mounds in the soil
          Atop each lies a small hole, sinking rapidly into darkness
          As you peer closer into one of the depressions, you hear a faint, sporadic clicking
          Like fingernails tapping on wood
          Like teeth closing together

  Mid Bottom Right:
    Title: Dead End
    Body: |
          You rise off the ground the see another stone wall blocking your path
          In the far corner, just below the wall, lies a shoe tangled in vines
          You attempt to pick it up, however years of untempered growth have strengthen the roots like steel
          As you pull away, you swear the vines had crept closer to your feet
          Your only way back is the way you came...under the vegetation.
