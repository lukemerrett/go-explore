    Title: Outside The Maze
    Body: |
          You stand at the edge of a large fortified maze
          12 foot high stone walls face you to the east and west, stretching far as the eye can see
          In front of you to the north is a small entrance, concealed under years of heavy foliage
          To the left is a sign that reads "A grand prize awaits you in the center, enter if you dare"

    Title: Going Home
    Body: |
          You gave up, and left the maze uncomplete
          Whilst you wonder what may have awaited you behind those walls
          You can't help but feel you made the right choice...

    Title: Dead End
    Body: |
          The path ends abruptly at a stone wall.
          On it, faint scratch marks can be seen on the ancient rock
          At your feet, you notice similar marks in the soil, as if someone, or something, was dragged away...

    Title: Overgrown
    Body: |
          The foliage here becomes almost oppressive, blocking what little light comes over the walls
          Pulling apart the branches, you see the path continues on to the north
          Though you will have to crawl under the vegetation to get through
    Transitions: 
      Mid Bottom Right: Go north
      Bottom Center: Go west
  Mid Bottom Left:
    Title: Doorway
    Body: |
          Ahead, you see the remnants of an old doorway, its frame set into the stone
          The wooden door itself lies torn to shreds further along the pathway
          Splinters litter the floor at your feet.

    Title: The Burrows
    Body: |
          As your trace the stone wall round, you notice a set of small mounds in the soil
          Atop each lies a small hole, sinking rapidly into darkness
          As you peer closer into one of the depressions, you hear a faint, sporadic clicking
          Like fingernails tapping on wood
          Like teeth closing together

  Mid Bottom Right:
    Title: Dead End
    Body: |
          You rise off the ground the see another stone wall blocking your path
          In the far corner, just below the wall, lies a shoe tangled in vines
          You attempt to pick it up, however years of untempered growth have strengthen the roots like steel
          As you pull away, you swear the vines had crept closer to your feet
          Your only way back is the way you came...under the vegetation.
    Transitions: 
      Bottom Right: Go south
  Center Left:
    Title: The Door
    Body: |
          You approach the door laid askew across the floor
          Solid metal hinges barely hold to the grain of the wood
          Whatever hit the door must have done so which some force
          Caught nestled under one hinge, you see a tuft of dark, brownish hair

    Title: The Tree
    Body: |
          The cave opens out into an enclosed room, dimly lit by candles flickering in the corner
          In the middle, a jet black tree stands shrouded in vines
          Each vine seeps with the sickly liquid, steadily flowing into the stream running under your feet
          As you approach the tree, the clicking becomes louder.  No longer behind you, but from inside the tree itself
          Silently, yet with purpose, tendrils reach out from the water, wrapping around your legs like a vice
          As you struggle in vain to move, the clicking rises to fill the room, eminanting from the tree itself
          The vines rise across your waist, to your shoulders, enveloping you, as the tree starts to turn
          Your eyes grow wide, dark branches close off your senses...

          The End.

    Title: Deeper, Deeper
    Body: |
          You knock your head on an unseen rock, and duck lower as the tunnel shrinks
          The clicking behind you grows more erractive, almost excited, as you bend lower into the opening
          Ahead, you see a dim light peeking out from the cave...
    Transitions: 
      Center Center: Go west
  Mid Top Left:
    Title: Footprints
    Body: |
          To the north, you see deep impressions of footprints
          These start in a straight line, yet quickly circle round back towards you
          The first part of their trail looks confident
          The last is more frantic, the footprints wider apart, as if the owner was running

    Title: Pillar
    Body: |
          Glass crunches underfoot as you approach a lone waist high pillar set in the middle of the path
          A broken vase sits turned upend atop the stonework.  
          A trail of jet black ooze trickles down the sides, long dried with time
    Transitions:
      Top Center: Go north
      Mid Top Left: Go west
  Mid Top Right:
    Title: Growling
    Body: |
          Behind you, towards the tunnel's opening, you hear the same unsettling clicking approach
          The space affords you no wiggle room, sound alone hints as to what is behind you
          Your hands are bathed in the unidentifiable liquid, you feel it cling to your arms as you proceed forward
          Whatever is behind you blocks your path, you must only go forward now
    Transitions: 
      Center Right: Go south

    Title: Mosaic
    Body: |
          Unlike the rest of the trail, the walls here are covered in mosaics
          Most have worn to illegibility with time
          One remains strangely unblemished.  You approach
          The piece shows a lone person, wandering slowly through a maze
          The maze is divided into squares, one with overgrown vegetation, one with a tattered door
          On the topmost segment, you can just make out a set of familar looking mosaics
          In the square, a large dark figure crouches, as if waiting
          It's eyes towards a broken doorway

    Title: Squeeze
    Body: |
          As you approach the northern corner of the maze, the stone walls narrow along the pathway
          Onwards to the east, you realise you will have to turn sideways and breath in to fit through the gap

    Title: Fading Light
    Body: |
          With a lethargic pace, you squeeze along the now restricted path
          You can no longer bend your head to see below you
          Liquid laps over your feet, an unknown viscous substance that seeps into your shoes
          To the south, the wall bends and arches into a small crawlspace
          The only way forward is on your knees
    Transitions: 
      Mid Top Right: Go south
      Top Right: Go north
