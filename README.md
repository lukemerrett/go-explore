## Configuring The Scenes

All the scenes and transitions are configured through a YAML file found in `resources/game-data.yaml`.

The format is:

```yaml
Configuration:
  Output Type: Console        # Only supports "Console" at the moment
Scenes:
  Scene Key:
    Title: Title of Scene
    Body: Body Text of Scene
    Start Scene: true         # Can be true or false, if not specified, defaults to false
    End Scene: false          # Can be true or false, if not specified, defaults to false
    Transitions:
      Scene Key: Text For Transition
```

For example:

```yaml
Configuration:
  Output Type: Console
Scenes:
  Home:
    Title: Your home
    Body: A house on a street in a neighbourhood
    Start Scene: true
    Transitions:
